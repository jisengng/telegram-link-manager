# ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Auto-Forwarder Script

## 🎯 You Probably Don't Need This

**This directory contains an advanced, optional auto-forwarding script.**

### ✅ Recommended: Use Manual Forwarding Instead

Manual forwarding is:
- ✅ **Simpler** - No setup required
- ✅ **More reliable** - Works immediately
- ✅ **Better control** - You choose what to save
- ✅ **No complications** - No API keys, no cloud deployment
- ✅ **Takes 2 seconds** - Just forward messages in Telegram

**Manual forwarding already works!** See `HOW_TO_USE_CHANNEL_FORWARD.md` in the project root.

## 📁 What's in This Directory?

These files provide **automated** forwarding (runs 24/7 on cloud):

- `forwarder.py` - Python script that monitors channels
- `setup_session.py` - Generates Telegram session
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Setup instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Cloud deployment guide

---

## ❓ When Would You Use This?

Only consider the auto-forwarder if:
- ❌ You follow 20+ very active channels
- ❌ You want every link captured automatically
- ❌ You're comfortable with Python and cloud deployment
- ❌ Manual forwarding feels too tedious

**For most users: Manual forwarding is better!**

## 🚀 If You Really Want Auto-Forwarding

1. Read `QUICKSTART.md` in this directory
2. Get Telegram API credentials
3. Deploy to cloud (Render/Railway/Oracle)
4. Monitor and maintain

**But seriously, try manual forwarding first!**

---

## 💡 The Bottom Line

**Manual forwarding works great. Use that.**

This auto-forwarder is here if you need it later, but most users never do.

See `HOW_TO_USE_CHANNEL_FORWARD.md` in the project root for the simple way.
